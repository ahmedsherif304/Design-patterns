>## State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.
---
>## to reduce the number of if/elses and switches in the classes
--------
>## if we have a lot of duplicate code according to the current state
-----
>## basically any object has states must use state pattern
---
>## don't use the state pattern when u use the state only once or have only 2 states and don't use them frequently
--- 
# Example
>## mobile phones in different states like ring, vibrate and mute the sounds acts differently according to each state
