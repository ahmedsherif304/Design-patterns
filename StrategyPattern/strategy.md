> ## Strategy pattern is a behavioral pattern that is being used when you want to have different behaviors for the same function for different subclasses

---

> ## there is one superclass that some classes inherit from it, and there is a function to be overridden to all these childs, but they behave differently according to their type

---

> ## when you want to change the behavior of classes dynamically

---

> ## it increases the number of classes, so the code becomes more complicated

---

> ## it is so much like the state pattern, but the state pattern changes in the same class, and the strategy pattern changes on the childs for the same parent class
