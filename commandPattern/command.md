> ## Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request 'command' into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request

---

> ## it cares about the **command** that is invoked to a receiver, not the invoker or the receiver itself

---

> ## if a device has a set of commands that are needed to be executed, but every user set his own set of commands

---

> ## like customizing your own smart home remote control that controls multiple devices

---

> ## we can use the same command in separate invokers without repeating the code

---

> ## we can make macro commands that have multiple commands inside it like **turning on lights ðŸ’¡**

---

> ## now undoing commands is easier to u can put every command that u use in a list and undo the commands using undo method easily and also can redo if u used undo

---

> ## Example photoShop buttons they have the same class button, and if making every command into a separate button subClass, this would be overhead and may lead to a code replication
